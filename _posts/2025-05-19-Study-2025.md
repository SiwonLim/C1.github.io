Security+ online class
- Nessus vulnerability scanner: Today I learned that Nessus can be installed on Windows. It's a tool that scans a machine's network to identify active hosts (IP addresses), vulnerability points with severity levels, and their history.
- Cracking password with Kali: I learned that if we obtain an LM Hash, we can try cracking it using `ophcrack` tool. However, if the plaintext password is complex, such as including symbols like an exclamation mark, `ophcrack` may fail. This helped me understand why using strong, complex password is important.
